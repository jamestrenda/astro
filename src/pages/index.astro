      These principles guide how I approach both my work and life. While I
      strive for constant growth, clear communication, and excellence, I
      recognize that, as an imperfect human being, I don't always hit the mark.
      I believe in the value of learning from mistakes, holding myself
      accountable, and focusing on progress rather than perfection.
